README for Assignment 4

Fall 2015 Comp 20
One Token Used 

I believe all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented, although I did have some difficulty finding problems with my partner's code.  As a result, I was really only able to find two security vulnerabilities, although I was able to demonstrate two different areas in which cross-site scripting was an issue - one in which the injected code affected mapchat and one in which it did not.  I found this assignment difficult because my partner did a good job preventing many of the attacks I attempted by correctly validating most input.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, other than briefly with my assigned partner.

This assignment took me longer than I expected because it was not easy to find vulnerabilities in the code. I probably spent 6 hours on this assignment.
