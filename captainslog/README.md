I think I implemented everything correctly.  I had difficulty using the toDateString() function, so I just used toString() which seems to work, although it's slighlty harder to read the output.  I also wasn't sure if the messages previously stored in local storage should be displayed when the page is loaded, or only once a new message is typed.  I implemented it so that they display when the page is loaded.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
I spent about 5 hours on this lab.
