A website that uses the Google Maps API to display the user's current location with a unique marker, as well as the locations, usernames and messages of other users that have been retrieved as JSON data.  Data is retrived using the XMLHttpRequest post object.  

I believe that all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. 
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
I think I spent 10 hours on this assignment? Maybe less.
