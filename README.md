#Lab 9 - Finalizing Your Learning Portfolio:
##Steven Manwaring
##Fall 2015 Comp 20 

1.) The purpose of this git repository is so that we have a portfolio of all the work we have done during the semester.  With this git repository, we can show our work to friends, family, and possible employers.  It also served as a great introduction to using git and github, and provides us with a space to work on future projects, as well as the knowledge of how to set up another git repository in the future if we need to. 

2.) I think my favorite assignment in this course was building the server for mapchat (Assignment 3).  This project was really neat because it taught us how to build our own database and server (which came in handing during our group project).  It also filled in a huge gap in my understanding of how web programming works, as before this section of the class I had only been exposed to client-side development.

3.) I think I have grown quite a bit since day 1 of this course.  Prior to taking this class I knew essentially nothing about web programming. While I still have quite a lot to learn about the field, I now feel much more comfortable with building web pages, server application, etc. I'm very glad I decided to take this course, and I really have enjoyed it so far.  

4.) I think one of the most important things I have learned in this course is how to use git/github.  This seems like it will be very useful in the professional world, and with any group project I might be a part of in the future.  The other most important thing I've learned is how to learn on my own. I know that Ming has this as one of his goals for the course, and it has worked well for me. I have now become accustomed to making heavy use of Google and Stack Overflow, and I think I have also become a better problem solver.  That being said, this course has also prompted me to seek help from TA's and classmates when needed. 

5.) I would definitely like to continue working with web development in the future.  I would like to become more comfortable with front-end/web design, using Bootstrap, for example.  One of my goals is to take the website I built for Assignment 1 and use what I have learned since then to improve my website and make it look more professional. 

Thanks for a great course!
