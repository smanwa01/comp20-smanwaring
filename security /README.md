README for Assignment 4
Steven Manwaring
Fall 2015 Comp 20

I believe all aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented, although I did have some difficulty finding problems with my partner's code.  They did a good job preventing many of the attacks I attempted by correctly validating most input.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, other than briefly with my assigned partner.

This assignment took me longer than I expected because it was not easy to find vulnerabilities in the code. I probably spent 6 hours on this assignment.
