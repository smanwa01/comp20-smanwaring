	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This page outlines the results of the assessment I conducted on the security risks found in my partner's <a href='http://murmuring-hamlet-4068.herokuapp.com/'>web application</a> for Comp 20 Assignment 3.  On this page, I describe the various security issues I discovered, and suggest ways in which they might be avoided.</p>  
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>I began my testing using the "black box" method.  I used Postman and Tamper Data for this portion of the assignment.  I then examined my partner's code to find addition areas where security risks might exist.  </p>
